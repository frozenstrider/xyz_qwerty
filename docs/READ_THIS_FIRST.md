# READ THIS FIRST â€” Build Plan for Manga_App (for Codex)

You are the coding assistant responsible for implementing the entire system.
This repository already contains service stubs, Docker wiring, a Flutter skeleton,
and interface contracts shaped around the **current pipeline** described in the handoff.

**Single source of truth:** `docs/SPEC_v2.md`  
**Your first tasks:** follow `docs/TASKS_MILESTONES.md`

Do not ask the user for engineering help. If you detect missing pieces, create the file(s),
update Docker/configs, and run the stack locally. Report blockers in console logs and continue.
